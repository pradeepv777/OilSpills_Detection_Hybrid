                    SAR-BASED MARINE OIL SPILL DETECTION SYSTEM
                    Hybrid DeepLabV3+ & SegNet Architecture
================================================================================

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
===================
This project implements a state-of-the-art deep learning system for detecting 
marine oil spills in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images using a 
hybrid architecture that combines DeepLabV3+ and SegNet models.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
======================
1. HYBRID MODEL:
   - Combines DeepLabV3+ and SegNet architectures
   - DeepLabV3+ provides multi-scale feature extraction with ASPP
   - SegNet provides fine-grained segmentation with encoder-decoder structure
   - Attention-based fusion mechanism intelligently combines both outputs
   - Total parameters: 71,249,298

2. DEEPLABV3+ COMPONENT:
   - ResNet50 backbone with pretrained ImageNet weights
   - Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for multi-scale features
   - Encoder-decoder with skip connections
   - Excellent for complex spatial patterns and large receptive fields

3. SEGNET COMPONENT:
   - Encoder-decoder architecture with max-pooling indices
   - Efficient memory usage and fine-grained segmentation
   - Good for edge preservation and detailed features
   - 13-layer deep network with batch normalization

4. FUSION MECHANISM:
   - Concatenates outputs from both models
   - Attention mechanism weights the contributions
   - Final convolutional layer produces refined predictions
   - Adaptive weighting for optimal performance

DATASET STRUCTURE:
=================
The system works with SAR images from two satellite sources:

TRAINING DATA (dataset/train/):
- PALSAR images: 5 samples (10782, 10789, 10795, 10798, 10806)
- Sentinel-1 images: 5 samples (20840, 20842, 20852, 20855, 20857)
- Format: JPG for satellite images, PNG for masks
- Resolution: Various sizes, resized to 512x512 during training

TEST DATA (dataset/test/):
- PALSAR images: 5 samples in separate sat/gt folders
- Sentinel-1 images: 5 samples in separate sat/gt folders
- Used for validation during training
